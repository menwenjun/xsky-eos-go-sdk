## Methods

### NewDpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicyCreateReq

`func NewDpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicyCreateReq(dpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicy DpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicyCreateReqPolicy, ) *DpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicyCreateReq`

NewDpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicyCreateReq instantiates a new DpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicyCreateReq object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewDpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicyCreateReqWithDefaults

`func NewDpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicyCreateReqWithDefaults() *DpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicyCreateReq`

NewDpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicyCreateReqWithDefaults instantiates a new DpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicyCreateReq object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetDpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicy

`func (o *DpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicyCreateReq) GetDpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicy() DpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicyCreateReqPolicy`

GetDpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicy returns the DpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicy field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetDpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicyOk

`func (o *DpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicyCreateReq) GetDpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicyOk() (*DpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicyCreateReqPolicy, bool)`

GetDpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicyOk returns a tuple with the DpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicy field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetDpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicy

`func (o *DpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicyCreateReq) SetDpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicy(v DpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicyCreateReqPolicy)`

SetDpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicy sets DpBlockAsyncReplicationPolicy field to given value.

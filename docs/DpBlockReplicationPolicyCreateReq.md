`func (o *DpBlockReplicationPolicyCreateReq) GetDpBlockReplicationPolicy() DpBlockReplicationPolicyCreateReqPolicy`

GetDpBlockReplicationPolicy returns the DpBlockReplicationPolicy field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetDpBlockReplicationPolicyOk

`func (o *DpBlockReplicationPolicyCreateReq) GetDpBlockReplicationPolicyOk() (*DpBlockReplicationPolicyCreateReqPolicy, bool)`
